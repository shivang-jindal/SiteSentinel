# Security Policy

SiteSentinel is uptime, endpoint, TLS and status-page monitoring for small teams. This document describes the security model of the repository, what is in
scope for a report, and how to report a vulnerability privately.

## Supported versions

| Version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| `main` (1.x) | Yes |
| Older commits, forks and tags | No |

Security fixes land on `main` only. There are no maintained release branches.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue, pull request or discussion for a security problem.**

Report privately with GitHub's advisory form:

<https://github.com/shivang-jindal/SiteSentinel/security/advisories/new>

Please include:

- the affected component — `client`, `server` or `shared`;
- reproduction steps, ideally a request/response pair or a short script;
- the impact you believe it has;
- whether any real data is involved.

What to expect:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Acknowledgement | Within 3 working days |
| First assessment | Within 10 working days |
| Fix or mitigation plan | Shared with the reporter before disclosure |
| Credit | Offered unless you ask otherwise |

Please do not access other users' data, do not run destructive or high-volume scans against
the demo instance, and give the maintainer a reasonable window to ship a fix before public
disclosure. Good-faith research that does not degrade the service is not treated as abuse.

## Scope

In scope: `client/`, `server/`, `shared/`, `scripts/`, the CI workflow, and the dependency
tree.

Out of scope: findings that require a deliberately unsafe operator setup — committed
secrets, TLS termination disabled, a database reachable from the internet, a shared
`ENCRYPTION_KEY` across deployments — and behaviour the README already documents as a
limitation.

## Security controls in this repository

- **Input validation.** Every request body, query string and path parameter is parsed with
  Zod schemas from `shared/` before it reaches domain code
  (`server/src/http/middleware.ts`). Domain functions receive typed values, never raw
  `req.body`.
- **Accounts and sessions.** Google is the only sign-in method in the web app. The browser
  obtains a Firebase ID token and the server verifies it against Google's published keys,
  including the project issuer and audience, `sign_in_provider === "google.com"` and a
  verified email. Accounts are matched by that verified email; a Google-created account has
  no password hash and cannot be reached with a password. Session tokens are 256-bit random
  values delivered in an HTTP-only, `SameSite` cookie; only the SHA-256 hash of the token is
  stored. Logout revokes the session server-side. Password endpoints exist only for local
  seeding and tests and return `404` when `NODE_ENV=production`.
- **Tenancy.** Every tenant-owned row carries an organisation id, and each request
  re-checks membership. A record that belongs to another tenant answers `404`, never
  `403`, so the API cannot be used to probe for foreign identifiers.
- **Security headers.** `helmet()` with Express's `x-powered-by` header disabled.
- **CORS.** An explicit origin allow-list from configuration; no wildcard with credentials.
- **Request size.** JSON bodies are capped at 1 MB.
- **Rate limiting.** `express-rate-limit` on the API surface. Counters are per process and
  in memory, so a multi-instance deployment needs a shared store.
- **Error handling.** Validation failures return `400` with field-level issues. Unexpected
  failures return a fixed message; stack traces are written to the server log only.
- **Logging.** Request logs record method, path, status and duration. Secrets, cookies and
  authorisation headers are not logged.
- **Secrets.** Configuration comes from environment variables. `.env` is git-ignored, and
  the browser bundle contains no server-side secret.
- **Dependencies.** Dependabot keeps minor and patch versions current; major upgrades are
  reviewed by hand. `npm audit` runs in CI.

## Data handling

SiteSentinel stores monitors, checks, incidents and status pages in a tenant-scoped
database. Local passwords exist only for the development seed and automated tests (Argon2id); session tokens are stored only as a SHA-256
hash. Alert-channel and integration credentials are sealed with AES-256-GCM using
`ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Probes resolve and validate every target before connecting, reject
private, loopback and link-local addresses, and re-check on each redirect to limit SSRF.

## Disclosure

This project follows coordinated disclosure: the fix and a GitHub security advisory are
published together, and the reporter is credited unless they prefer otherwise. Reporters
who need a CVE identifier can ask for one in the advisory thread.

## Questions

Security questions that are not vulnerability reports can go to the maintainer,
[@shivang-jindal](https://github.com/shivang-jindal), as a normal GitHub issue.
